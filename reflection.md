- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think inheritance is cool. I love the way it organizes classes as children of other classes, and I like that it makes programming less repetative. I feel like I'm developing this sixth sense where I'll be writing some code, realize I've already done something similar, and change my program so I only have to write said thing once. Knowing about inheritance just increases my tool box for making my code more straight forward. This homework actually went really smooth and I'm hoping there arn't going to be too many issues. I did a lot of corrections on past homeworks over break, so I think I just understand java a lot better right now. Following the readme helped me make sure I was doing all the right steps and had all the required documents. I also really appreciated having the interfaces because they stop me from making spelling/naming mistakes.
